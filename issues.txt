Bug Reports:

1. link local addresses break the program, possibly in the find() finction of autoDiscovery, or in getIp/configure. Also wipes the config file so bricks the unit.

2. sometimes the file gets corupted whilst writing. either get a blank file or extra charicters where they are not meant to be, maybe look at the debounce thing.
